## Future Project Ideas

### Analyze NASA public data

### RunTracker AI

### Selenium SIS Registration Bot

### ML to find what songs that are most common/define a love playlist on Spotify

### Transloc Addition to Route Finding (Google Maps API)

### OpenCV that can track human action, and have them perform some stream of action that acts as a password

### AI that learns how you think, and can predict what you mean when you type something 
  it can find associated phrases that may better convey your meaning, especially when searching for document tites
  basically SEO for your brain and document organization systems

### Pomodoro application that counts up and always stays on your screen.

### Metal membership cards that can scan and grant access to things

### Map of average Chipotle chicken bowl cost by country, can use API or selenium to find it

### Personalized Dex made for keeping up with friends
  It can rate friendships and be more specific for friends

### Deep Learning Model for Tagging Players
  AI model that produces a confidence rating for who it thinks a picture of a sports player could be, can look based on face, number, and more
  Can also integrate a program/website that helps people easily categorize by renaming files based on who it is

Feel free to take any of these ideas, these are simply ideas that I think will be fun and/or benefit society in some way.
